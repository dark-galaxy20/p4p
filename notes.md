Session 2 | 1399/1/2

Today I Found out the usage and advantages of Git and Github & I understood how a  dev team can work together on a project from different parts of the world and understood what a version controlled work is .

I became more fluent in 'Markdown' programming language as I can write these notes with 'markdown' . 

We scheduled our curriculum and decided to do [practice python](http://www.practicepython.org/) projects first and then go for [Raspberrypi.org](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub/python-module-1) I projects and then go for [Raspberrypi.org](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub/python-module-2) II projects.
  
 Every week I'm going to make a weekly schedule for my self and place the projects im going to do in 'to do' section in project section in github, after doing them every week we will check them together
