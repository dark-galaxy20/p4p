# Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping.
#  One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.
# (If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. And yes,
#  happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. 
#  The explanation is easier with an example,
# which I will describe below.)
